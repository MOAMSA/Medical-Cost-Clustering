# Clustering using Insurance Dataset (Medical Charge) 
Health insurance which covers the whole or a part of the risk of a person incurring medical expenses, spreading the risk over a large number of persons. We will apply Exploratory Data Analysis to be familiarized with the data. Then, we will implement K-Means and Hierarchical algorithms to divide the data point to some group with similar properties. The Table of content is as follow:
+ About the Insurance Dataset
+ Methodology
+ Exploratory Data Analysis
  * Distribution of BMI, age and, charges
  * Distribution of gender, smoking, no. of children and residential area
  * Distribution of age
  * Features relationship
  * Effects of BMI categories, age and, smoking on charges
  * Correlation for different BMI categories
  * Effect of gender on charges
  * Effect of Resident Area on charges
+ Clustering Algorithms
  * K-Means method
    * K-Mean: Charges - Age
    * K-Mean: Charges - BMI
  * Hierarchical clustering (Agglomerative)
    * Hierarchical : Charges - BMI
  * Future Work (K-Mode algorithm)
